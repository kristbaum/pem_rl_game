# ChessBrawl

TODOs (to be updated)
- A: Study the suitable hyperparameters in .yaml for training the model
- B: Implement the behaviors of agents in C# scripts
- C: Design the environments/scenes in Unity
- D: Add visual, sound effects and animations

Subtasks:
- Design a simple scene with 1 chessboard, 2 agents, and chess pieces
- Consider how to implement the behaviors of agents to kick the chess pieces
- Consider how to implement the chess pieces to move forward or kick other chess pieces
- Consider which information needed to feed the agents to solve desired tasks
- Implement the setup of the environment for a new episode e.g. OnEpisodeBegin() in C#
- Implement observing behaviors of agents e.g. CollectObservations(VectorSensor sensor) in C#
- Implement the actions of agents e.g. OnActionReceived(ActionBuffers actionBuffers) in C#
- Implement the collisions of the agents with walls, other chess pieces, goals
- Implement the rewards for agents
- Implement the human player mode
- Study self-play strategy for multi agents in adversarial games
- Implement self-play mode in .yaml and C#
- Study and test different hyperparameters for training the model
- Implement the policy and optimizer for the trainer in Python (PPO, SAC, POCA or self-made trainer)
- Set up corresponding configuration files .yaml
- Train the agents
- Test the learning with inference model
- Test the learning with heuristic mode
- Design creative chess figures, agents 
- Add sound, visual effects, animations


How to train the model/agents on Windows: (can be done in a separated environment/project)
1. Make sure ml-agents is installed, a virtual environment is activated
2. Navigate to the downloaded folder ml-agents -> `mlagents-learn <path to configuration file .yaml> <optional run-id>`
3. Wait until a port is listening
4. Navigate to the unity project -> click on start button

How to stop the training:
- a. Click on stop button in unity, can start the training again when clicking on play button again
- b. Strg C 

How to test the model/agents on Windows: (can be done in a separated environment/project)
- a. Test the behaviors (for human play mode)
  - Navigate to agents objects in unity project -> Behavior Parameters -> Behavior Type -> Heuristic Only -> use key board or mouse to test the agents
- b. Test the trained model:
  - Navigate to agents objects in unity project -> Behavior Parameters -> Behavior Type -> Inference Only
  - Navigate to /results -> find the trained model -> drag it into the unity project -> add it as model in Behavior Parameters -> click on play button 


Take-away from presentation:
* Using the chess engine should be only done if the Agent actually needs to do anything. (For testing it would be nice to just use the engine to see if it can learn the physical task to move a figure across the board)
* Maybe use a pool ball additionally, to add the complexity to the game
* Test how hard it is for a user, the agent can do the physical task way easier, maybe add a target mark for users
* Something else?

# Setup
Install Unity (https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html#install-hub-linux)
Add the correct packages (https://unity-technologies.github.io/ml-agents/com.unity.ml-agents/)
