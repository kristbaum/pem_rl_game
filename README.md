# Pool Chess (Working title)

Chess with pool cues. A Reinforcement Learning game implemented in Unity. 

TODO:
* find existing (open source) implementation of pool/billiard game for unity, to steal the control mechanism
* find existing (open source) implementation of (3D) chessboard, to steal the assets
* decide on a chess engine
* test the learing
* Decide on a game name: Pool Chess, Cue Chess, Chess Billiard, Chess Billiards, Chess Pool?


Take-away from presentation:
* Using the chess engine shold be only done if the Agent actually needs to do anything. (For testing it would be nice to just use the engine to see if it can learn the physical task to move a figure across the board)
* Maybe use a pool ball aditionally, to add complexitiy
* Test how hard it is for a user, the agent can to the phisical task way more easy, maybe add a target mark for users
* Something else?
